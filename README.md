# VBAscript
The .bas file "VBAofWallStreet" is the code I used on the data. I realize it does not conditionally format the cells for the color of the "annual change." I was not able to get the code to run with the conditional code included. I've included a second .bas file called VBAofWallStreet.2, it includes the code for the conditional color change piece. I'll try to get that code to work over the holiday break.
