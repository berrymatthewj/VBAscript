# VBAscript
The .bas file "VBAofWallStreet" is the code I used on the data. The three snips are screenshots of 2016, 2015, and 2014. I don't know why the data prints on the 2015 and 2014 sheets but not the 2016 sheet. I realize it does not conditionally format the cells for the color of the "annual change." I was not able to get the code to run with the conditional code included. I've included a second .bas file called VBAofWallStreet.2, it includes the code for the conditional color change piece. I'll try to get that code to work over the holiday break.
